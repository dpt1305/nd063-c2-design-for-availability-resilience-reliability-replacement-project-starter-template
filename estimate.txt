According to the AWS RDS document (https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/), we can believe in AWS's abilities while using the full-managed services such as RDS.
We can achieve the system with the high availability, reliability and resiliency by using Multi-AZ RDS.
In this case, we are desiring to use 2 RDS instances on 2 regions (1 master - 1 replica).   
Therefore, in single AZ outage case, we can expect that minumum RTO is 1 second and minimum RPO is 10 seconds
In case of region outage, I estimate minimum 5 minutes RTO and minimum 30 minutes RPO, hence it takes more time for promoting the replica instance or our staffs can go to the office for solving the accidents. 

In summary, this is my estimation for my system:
1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 1 second
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 5 minutes
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 10 second
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 30 minutes
